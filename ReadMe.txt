--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon opening the zip file navigate to the 'html' folder and open 'Log_In_Page.html'

This will open up the log in page in your default browser, in order to join a chat 
you will need to create a username, to do this type the name you would like in the box and 
press the 'ENTER' button on the screen or on your keyboard. Failure to add a username will
result in the web page informing the user one is required.

Upon entering the chat environment you will see three columns of information, the left is 
the available rooms, the middle is the message area, and the right is a list of users in all
rooms.

Upon entering the chat environment you will not have joined any rooms, you will see a list of 
chat room which you can join on the left hand side of the screen. You will need to select
one of these rooms to join a chat. Alternately you can create a new room to join by
typing the name in to the box to the left of the 'create room' button'. Note leaving this box empty 
will result in a message to the user to enter a room name.

Once a room has been selected or created the right panel will be filled with the users
in the room. The left hand panel will highlight the room you are currently in (this highlighting
may look a little brutal in comparison to the rest of our subtle, clean theme. This is to hopefully
allow people using poor display equipment to more easily see the selected room). The centre 
panel will show all the messages previously sent in the room or will be blank if there are no
previous messages. The user can scroll the middle panel up to see more past history of messages
sent in the selected room.

In order to send a message you type it in the box to the right of the send button. Then 
to send the message either press the send button or press enter on your keyboard. 
The message will be displayed in the panel in the centre on the right hand side of the screen
in a light green colour. Messages from other people in the room will appear on the left hand 
side of the middle section in a darker shade of green.

In order to embed youtube videos simple paste the url into the message box and either
press enter on the keyboard or click the 'send' button on the page, this will create an embedded 
youtube video within a message bubble which can be watched from the chat room.

Note - some youtube videos will embed but will not play, upon some internet research it appears 
video owners can restrict embedding (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6301625?hl=en),
also it appears (according some discussion forums) that loading pages locally affects 
the playability of videos, and that hosting the page on a server will solve the problem.
We have not been able to test this.
